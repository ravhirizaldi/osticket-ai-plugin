## üõ† Development

If you want to develop this plugin:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ravhirizaldi/osticket-ai-plugin.git
cd osticket-ai-plugin
```

### Recommended Tools
- **[Intelephense](https://intelephense.com/)** ‚Äî Recommended for PHP development to enable intelligent code completion, type hints, and symbol navigation.  
  After installing it in your IDE (e.g., VSCode), add the following to your `settings.json` so Intelephense can recognize osTicket's core files:

```json
"intelephense.environment.includePaths": [
    "C:/Users/DELL/Documents/CAJ/Code/osticket/include"
]
```

Modify the code as needed, then reload the plugin in osTicket to test your changes.
